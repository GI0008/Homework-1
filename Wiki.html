            <hr>
            <p>
                <strong>Web development</strong> is the work involved in developing a <a href="">website</a> for the <a href="">Internet</a> (<a href="">World Wide Web</a>) or an <a href="">intranet</a> (a private network).<sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup> <br>
                Web development can range from developing a simple single <a href="">static page</a> of <a href="">plain text</a> to complex <a href="">web applications</a>, <a href="">electronic businesses,</a> and <a href="">social network services</a>. <br> A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, <br>
                may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and <br>
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing <a href="">markup</a> <br>
                and <a href="">coding</a>.<sup><a href="">[2]</a></sup> Web development may use <a href="">content management systems</a> (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills
            </p>
            <p>
                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (<a href="">Web developers</a>) and follow standard methods like <br>
                <a href="">Agile methodologies</a> while developing Web sites.<sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup> Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, <br> 
                or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a <a href="">graphic designer</a> or <a href="">information systems</a> technician. <br>
                Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. <br>
                There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: <a href="">front-end developer</a>, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.<sup><a href="">[3]</a></sup> <br>
                Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.<sup><a href="">[4]</a></sup> <br>
                Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

            <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Origin/Web 1.0</h3>
            <p><a href="">Tim Berners-Lee</a> created the <a href="">World Wide Web</a> in 1989 at CERN.<sup><a href="">[5]</a></sup></p>
            <p>The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with <br>
                institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, <a href="">HTML</a> was developed in 1993.<sup><a href="">[6]</a></sup></p>
            <p> Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information.<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup> <br>
                Core protocols of web 1.0 were <a href="">HTTP</a>, HTML and <a href="">URI</a>.<sup><a href="">[8]</a></sup></p>
            <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
            <p><a href="">Web 2.0</a>, a term popularised by <a href="">Dale Dougherty</a>, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, <br>
                marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.<sup><a href="">[9]</a><a href="">[10]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only nature of Web  <br> 
                1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a user-focused, read-write online network.<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup></p>
            <p>In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities such as creating music, files, images, and movies.<sup><a href="">[11]</a></sup> <br>
                The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the "backbone of the internet," using standardized <a href="">XML</a> (Extensible Markup Language) <br>
                tags to authorize information flow from independent platforms and <a href="">online databases</a>.<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup>
                </p>

            <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
            <p>Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign of the web. <br>
                Key features include the integration of <a href="">metadata</a>, precise information delivery, and improved <a href="">user experiences</a> based on preferences, history, and interests.<sup><a href="">[citation needed]</a></sup> </p>
            <p>
                Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than traditional search engines. <br>
                Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles.<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup></p>    
            <p>
                This version is sometimes also known as <a href="">Semantic Web</a>.<sup><a href="">[12]</a></sup> </p>    

            <h3>Evolution of web development technologies</h3>
            <p>
                The journey of web development technologies began with simple <a href="">HTML</a> pages in the early days of the internet. Over time, <br>
                advancements led to the incorporation of <a href="">CSS</a> for styling and <a href="">JavaScript</a> for interactivity. This evolution transformed static <br>
                websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.</p>
